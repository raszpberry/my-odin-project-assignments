# Odin Project: Recipes (Pastamiya!)

Pastamiya! is a raw html website that contains 3 popular italian cousine.

## What I Learned:
- Hyperlinks
- "../" vs "./"
- "src" vs "href"

## Conclusion:
This project will help you know how different pages in a website are connected. This can also help you somewhat memorize git commands and the html boilerplate.
